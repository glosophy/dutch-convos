## :octocat: Repo Content
This repo includes:

* `images`: folder with the final images

This repo does not include:
* The chat transcript, duh.

## :memo: Project Description
As someone who loves measuring everything, I thought it would be fun to get some patterns/data out of the conversations between these two people who are now far away from each other. *Oh, das Fernweh*. 

It resembles the distance and the desire to be somewhere else.


## :bar_chart: Data Visualization
I was going for two slopegraphs, but I didn't have enough data to make it work the way I wanted to. So I scaled the project down a notch and went with a simpler dataviz: ten slopegraphs. I might be adding more layers of data to this project as time permits.


## :eyeglasses: Where can I see the final project?
I uploaded some of the images on [my Behance account](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129390297/Voces-del-tiempo-Stemmen-van-de-tijd). Enjoy!
