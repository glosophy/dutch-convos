## :memo: Project Description
As someone who loves measuring everything, I thought it would be fun to get some patterns/data out of my conversations with a Dutch friend of mine. I turned the designs into postcards. There is something painful and at the same time beautiful about distance and longing to always be far away. *Oh, das Fernweh*. 

These postcards resemble that distance and the desire to be somewhere else.


## :bar_chart: Data Visualization
I was going for two slopegraphs, but I didn't have enough data to make it work the way I wanted to. So I scaled the project down a notch and went with a simpler dataviz. I might be adding more viz to this project as time permits. It is one of the most personal projects I have ever worked on.


## :eyeglasses: Where can I see the final project?
I uploaded some of the images on [my Behance account](https://www.behance.net/gallery/125653309/Stemmen-van-de-tijd-Voces-del-tiempo). Enjoy!
